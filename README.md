## Title: Simulation of Equivalence Ratio Control Capability

The fuel–air equivalence ratio (Phi) of a combustion system such as internal combustion engine or combustion turbine is defined as the ratio of the fuel-to-oxidizer ratio to the stoichiometric fuel-to-oxidizer ratio. Fuel-air ratio (FAR) is the mass ratio of fuel to air present in the combustion process. If exactly enough air is provided to completely burn all of the fuel, the ratio is known as the stoichiometric mixture [1]. In certain situations it is important to ensure an accurate and precise equivalence ratio (Phi) measurement and control. To help optimize equivalence ratio (Phi) measurement and control system design, it is essential to understand the combine control and measurement capability of the equivalence ratio control system.

In this Shiny App, bulk Phi variation that the combustion control system is designed to regulate is simulated by combining the two inputs. These inputs are stoichiometric combustion Phi probability distribution, and Oxygen measurement sensor precision (measurement error probability distribution). It is assumed that both input variations are Gaussian or Normal in nature. User can change the default mean and standard deviation for each of the input probability distribution with in the realistic limits dictated by the actual physical process. The bulk Phi distribution is then calculated by combining the two input sampled distributions.
